Hello! I want to share with you an amazing journey into the world of programming that started from scratch and led me to create my own website and programs. Yes, you heard it right, I learned to program without even knowing code or English, thanks to the power of artificial intelligence.

My journey began with a desire to create something unique in the online world, but I faced a problem - I didn't know how to code, and my English was at a basic level. Nevertheless, I didn't give up. Discovering numerous tools and platforms developed with the application of artificial intelligence, I realized there was an opportunity for me.

Using tools like visuaLangua or Bubble, I started creating my website and applications without resorting to coding. Thanks to the intuitively understandable interface and automated processes, I was able to bring my ideas to life even without possessing technical skills.

But that's not all. I also used artificial intelligence to study the basics of programming. Through online courses and educational materials available in Russian, I learned the fundamentals of algorithms, data structures, and other programming concepts.

Today, I can proudly say that I not only created my website and software but also continue to develop in the field of programming. My experience proves that thanks to artificial intelligence, there are no limitations if you have the desire to learn and grow. After all, in the modern world of technology, the possibilities are endless!
